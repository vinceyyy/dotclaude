# Learning

`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` is your long-term memory across projects. Keep it current:

- **Encode**: When you discover a reusable pattern during development, add a one-line cue under "Learned Patterns": key
  insight, when it applies, source project and date
- **Recall**: When starting a project, scan Learned Patterns for matching cues. Search episodic memory for the source
  conversation if details are needed
- **Forget**: When adding a new entry, review existing ones. Remove entries that are outdated, contradicted by newer
  learning, or never proved useful. Keep under 50 entries
