# Git Rules

## Branch Safety

- **Always use feature branches** — never commit directly to main
- **Never force push** to main/master
- **No git worktrees** unless explicitly requested

## Branch Naming

```
feat/description      # New features
fix/description       # Bug fixes
refactor/description  # Code restructuring
```

## Push New Branches

Always use `-u` flag: `git push -u origin HEAD`

## Before Merging

Run the `code-simplifier` skill on the entire codebase before merging or creating a PR. Triage the findings:

- **In-scope issues** (related to the current PR's changes): fix them in this branch
- **Out-of-scope issues** (pre-existing or unrelated): notify the user, write a plan to `docs/working/`, and address
  them in a separate branch/PR

## Pull Request Format

```markdown
## Summary
[2-4 bullet points covering ALL changes — analyze full branch, not just latest commit]

## Test plan
- [ ] Verification steps as a checklist
```
